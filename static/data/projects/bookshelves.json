  "description": "<p>Web and mobile application project where the back-end can **create a database** from a list of **EPUB files** by extracting the metadata of each EPUB to create **authors**, **series** and books while managing the **relationships between each model**, without leaving out information such as **tags**, **publisher**, **ISBN**, **language** and **description**. Information that cannot be retrieved from the EPUB file metadata is retrieved from external **APIs such as Wikipedia or Google Books**. All this allows to manage a complete database presenting all the books presented on the front of the application that allows to **consult each entity with its relations** and to download the books. <br/><br/>- It is possible to **search by entity** in order to find a book more easily<br/>- Detailed guides help to better understand how to use a reader to read EPUB files<br/>- A **comments** and **favorites** system is also available for registered users<br/>- A **contact form** allows to send messages to the team. <br/>- Embeds the **OPDS** (Open Publication Distribution System) to offer books to applications that offer this feed but also **Catalog** which offers a simplified interface to be able to browse Bookshelves from the e-reader's web browser if it doesn't support OPDS<br/>- Available in dark mode<br/>- Offers an API documentation with **scribe**</p>\n",

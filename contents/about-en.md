I started to develop my first real projects with Laravel (PHP), learning also to use Git. But I'm also very interested in the user experience, which pushes me to keep a link with the front-end with Vue.js and Nuxt.js (JavaScript / TypeScript) with CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS. I want to implement the necessary for SEO, although I am not an expert in this field. On the mobile side, beyond web responsive, I do Flutter (Dart) in order to be able to deploy applications on Android and on iOS.

I like to have knowledge on each part of the chain, from local development to deployment on a server (with NGINX), which leads me to configure quite often Linux servers for both production and local development. Therefore, I like to have efficient tools, whatever the development environment (Linux, Windows or macOS) to be able to easily use such or such version of a language.

I develop best in groups, preferring communication and help to isolated development, as long as I have colleagues who also enjoy this way of working. I love to discuss technologies, I'm interested in the latest versions of the languages I use and I spend a lot of time reading documentation or making it, in Markdown of course. I always have too many projects on the go, but I also always have something to do!

My favorite tools are :

- IDE : [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- System: macOS (M1 chip), Android
- Server: [Linux Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
- Main technologies : [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- In addition : [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Ray](https://myray.app/)

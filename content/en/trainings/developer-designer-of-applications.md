A vocational training for the CDA title. 25% of the time per month at the ENI school and 75% of the time at UseWeb. This company creates websites for clients, with a front-end in NuxtJS (VueJS) and a back-end in Laravel. My role is usually to work on the front-end but sometimes I have to work on the back-end as well, or to build an entire application. Most of the time I work in a small team of three people, I am followed by my team for the technical questions and the manager for the business questions. The school trains me on several technologies: project management, managing a web server, Java EE, ASP.net, cross-platform, analysis and design, Symfony, Android. My skills are evaluated to obtain the title of application developer (bac+4).
